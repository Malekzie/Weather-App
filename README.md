# Weather app

A simple application showing the rendering of the fetched data from an api in multiple ways

## Stack used

- **[Sveltekit](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte)** - Framework of choice
- **[Shadcn/Sveltekit](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com/)** - UI Component library with **TailwindCSS**
- **[OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)** - API Used for calling Weather Data

## TO BE IMPLEMENTED

- [x] - Search implementation to view a city
- [ ] - A map to show current weather forecasts ( **Probably not going to be implemented due to api cost restrictions** )
- [ ] - Saving favorite cities

# Disclaimer

I am making this application to the best of the restrictions posed on the scope of the app like api costs, etc.
